## Stablecoin as a Service

Stablecoin as a service is a universal solution for businesses and governments to quickly and efficiently issue their own stable cryptocurrency tied to a reserve asset or Fiat.

- For companies: Businesses can release their own branded digital tokens to offer incentives for their customers, build customer loyalty and encourage money to be kept within their ecosystem.

- For Governments: Central Banks can issue digital currencies (CBDC) that can be used as a digital national currency. With CBDC stablecoins, citizens retain access to the safest form of money - a claim on a central bank. This could promote diversity in payment options, make cross-border payments faster and cheaper, increase financial inclusion and facilitate fiscal transfers in times of economic crisis.
